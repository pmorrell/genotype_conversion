# A Python script for genotype conversion

The script takes genotype calls from Alchemy in the format 'AA', 'AC', 'CA', or 'CC' and converts them to a format used by various programs where the genotype is represented by the count of number of observations of the minor allele. 

An example dataset is provided in test.txt.
