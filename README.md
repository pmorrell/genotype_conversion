# A Python script for genotype conversion

The script takes genotype calls from [Alchemy] (http://alchemy.sourceforge.net) in the format 'AA', 'AC', 'CA', or 'CC' and converts them to a format where the genotype is represented by the count of number of observations of the minor allele. Genotypes are reported as '0', '1', or '2' based on the number of minor alleles. Missing data is recorded as 'NA' and is returned in that same form. The 'NA' values do not contribute to minor allele counts.

Example datasets are provided in test.txt, test2.txt, and test3.txt.


##Known Issues

###Resolved Issues
- Loci that include only 'NA' values. These genotypes are simply returned as NA. 

###Unresolved Issues
- Genotypes in some data files are represented as 'AA', 'AB', or 'BB'. This should generally not occur with data directly from Alchemy, but is a problem in some of our data files.
- Datafiles with a newline ('\n') at the end of the file don't work. The genotype_conversion.py returns only the headers.
